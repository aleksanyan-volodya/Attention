# Emotion Recognition with Attention

This project focuses on recognizing emotions from user messages using an
attention-based architecture inspired by *Attention Is All You Need*. The
Streamlit app is intentionally minimal while the core model work evolves.

## Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Docs

Sphinx documentation lives in [docs/](docs/). Build with:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
